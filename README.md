## üåü Abstract

This project focuses on enabling robust WebAssembly (WASM) support for Apache DataFusion. By compiling core DataFusion components to WASM, exposing stable JS interfaces, and delivering a live playground, this work allows users to execute SQL queries directly in the browser ‚Äî securely, privately, and without backend infrastructure.

Deliverables include a browser-based demo, improved bindings, test coverage, CI integration, and a release plan for long-term WASM maintenance.

---

## ‚úÖ Benefits to the Community

- Empower **local-first SQL analytics** directly in the browser
- Lower the entry barrier for learning and using DataFusion
- Enable **privacy-aware data processing** (no server or upload)
- Lay the foundation for notebook and visualization integrations
- Establish a maintainable WASM support pipeline
